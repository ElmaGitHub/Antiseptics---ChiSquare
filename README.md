# Antiseptics---ChiSquare
Compare four antiseptics usage across three clinics (Python)

Medical researchers are trying to understand if four topical antiseptics are being used in the same ratio at three different clinics in town. They have access to medical records over the past 3 years, and have recorded each treatment where a topical antiseptic was used.
Using a tally sheet, they have determined how many times each antiseptic was used in each of the three clinics, and they want to compare the antiseptic usage across the three clinics.
